Sheepit-for-WordPress
=====================

Sheepit jquery library integration for WordPress (Basic)

So far this is just a basic integration of the library, but it works with Contact Form 7! 

Front end users can "clone" fields, adding new rows to contact forms and other forms dynamically.

The original jQuery library was released under the MIT license. 

This WordPress plugin is released under the GNU general public license version 2.0
