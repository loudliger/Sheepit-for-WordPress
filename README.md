Sheepit-for-WordPress
=====================

Sheepit jquery library integration for WordPress (Basic)

So far this is just a basic integration of the library, but it works with Contact Form 7! 

Front end users can "clone" fields, adding new rows to contact forms and other forms dynamically. 

For more information see the following link: http://www.mdelrosso.com/sheepit/index.php?lng=en_GB

The original jQuery library was released under the MIT license. 

This WordPress plugin is released under the GNU general public license version 2.0

To customize the functionality of the plugin, use the custom HTML and javascript snippets provided in the original Sheepit 
documentation.

You can use the Javascript code from the Sheepit demos by replacing the js code written in the file "sheepit.php".

To use with Contact Form 7, you will get best results if you build your form with HTML input tags instead of the Contact Form 7
tags. In the future I hope to develop this into a stable plugin with full Contact Form 7 integration, but for now it only
provides the basic functionality.
