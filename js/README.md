------------------

**Configuration options:**

**Advanced controls:**
Add multiple forms at the same time, remove the last one and remove all are some of the advanced controls that sheepIt provides. 

**Web designers friendly:**
SheepIt! use the same template that the designer can see in your editor, easy to upgrade the design. 

**Data injection:**
Thanks to the API inject() method, sheepIt lets you load an array of data to the entire form, to an embedded clone form or to a specific clone. 
The method will perform all operations necessary to load the information provided, taking into account the existing clones and configurations. 

**Callback functions:**
The callBack functions used to run custom codes before or after you add a clone to the form. 
So, for example, to set validation to forms cloned. 

**Nested forms:**
A person has multiple addresses and an address may have multiple phones. 
Nested forms can handle such complex situations 

**Pre-generated forms:**
SheepIt! can identify pre-generated clones at the html code and integrate them so as to handle them like the rest. 
This is very useful to interact with form frameworks as used in Symfony for PHP. 

**API to control the form from Javascript:**
The plugin exposes a number of methods for controlling the form using Javascript in the same way that the user controls in your browser.
